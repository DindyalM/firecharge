 ## About
 
 We made FireCharge as the final project for a PHP class.
 
 Starting with the brainstorming phase, we wanted to choose a project with enough of a challenge to be engaging, while being simple enough for us to focus on building our own tools instead of relying on frameworks.
 
 By basically bashing rocks together (html, css, javascript and php) we we're able to get a fully functional web app working!
 
 ## Process
 
 Our team decided to collaborate using pair-programming, utilising the online text editor C9, during our sprints.
 
 In theory it's a pretty good idea, but in practice we just ended up making fun of each other constantly.
 
 The most fun part was implementing our own MVC architecture. At first it completely broke everything.
 
 It felt like entering a party where everyone is speaking German and there's a monkey in the fruit punch.
 
 But a few Wikipedia articles later our controller was routing, our model was getting data and our views were saying a bit more than "Hello World!".
 
 ## Lessons Learned
 
 Working with the FireCharge team was a lot of fun.
 
 Of course we learned a lot about PHP and web development,
 
 But we also learned the importance of having a culture of learning, a belief in process and enjoying the little things.
 
 ### Some Takeaways:
 
 * Every bug is a new chance to learn.
 * Working with the basics can improve your productivity with the big guns.
 * Software Development is always about the people, invest in the education of your group members.
 
 ## Presentation
 
 This project has been presented and some notes on that.
 
 I was really proud with how passionately everyone was able to talk about everything from the development challenges to the inspiration behind the idea.
 
 It seems everyone on the team learned a lot and was excited to discuss about the lessons in both in both the technical side and the process.
 
 ## Summary
 
 * Created full-stack web app from idea
 * Learned some PHP and MySQL
 * Learned how to work with a development team
 
 * Even more motivated to create the next project!
